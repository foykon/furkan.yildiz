Example Question:
"Library Book Management System"
A library wants to manage its book inventory and borrowers. The system should:

Keep track of all books available in the library.

Each book can have multiple copies.

Keep track of borrowers and which books they have borrowed.

Prevent a borrower from borrowing the same copy of a book more than once.

Maintain the order in which books are added to the inventory.

Tasks:
Design collections to store books, their copies, and borrowers' borrowing records.

Display all books currently borrowed by a specific borrower.

Find out how many copies of a particular book are currently borrowed.

Ensure no duplicate borrowers exist in the system.

Preserve the order of books as they are added to the inventory.

Suggested Use of Collections:
Set: To store unique borrowers or unique copies of books a borrower has borrowed.

List: To keep the ordered list of books in the inventory.

Map: To associate borrowers with the sets of book copies they have borrowed (Map<Borrower, Set<BookCopy>>).
